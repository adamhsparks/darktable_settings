# darktable_stuff

## settings

Files in this folder are my preferred settings for using darktable on. These
give a bit more room for editing photos, using smaller font sizes and side bars.

* In `darktable_css`, set default font sizes to 5/10.5pt and uses Lucida Grande
rather than Sans.

* In `darktablerc`, sidebars are set to 300px.

## styles

My own styles I've developed for darktable
